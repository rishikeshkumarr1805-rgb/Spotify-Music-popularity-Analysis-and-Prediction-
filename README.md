# 🎵 Spotify Music Popularity Analysis and Prediction

### 📖 Overview
This project analyzes Spotify songs to discover what makes a track popular.  
Using **R programming**, it explores relationships between audio features and popularity through **data cleaning, visualization, correlation analysis,** and **linear regression modeling**.

---

### 🧰 Tech Stack
- **Language:** R  
- **Tools:** RStudio  
- **Libraries:** `tidyverse`, `corrplot`, `GGally`, `caret`, `ggthemes`  
- **Dataset:** `spotify.csv` (audio features and popularity data)

---

### ⚙️ How It Works
1. Load and clean Spotify dataset.  
2. Perform **EDA** – visualize feature distributions & correlations.  
3. Build **Linear Regression Model** to predict song popularity.  
4. Evaluate model using **RMSE** metric.  
5. Visualize top 10 most popular artists.
